# Coding Challenge for a backend.

Build a simple API that scrape a site.

I put up this challenge on [CODEWARS](http://codewars.com) (was rated about 2 kata) a year ago and became really popular among the community of hackers. It was a short challenge that took 2 - 3 hours and most developers had fun building it and continue to use it for other everyday purposes. The idea and concept of it applies to real life applications that are relevant in today's data-driven world.

- Language: Javascript
- Technology: Node.js, Express
- Difficulty: Medium
- Completion time: 2 - 3 hours. Took lead engineer 1.5 hour to complete. Shoudn't take you more than 5 hours. It doesn't count against you, but please explain why and provide evidence to prove your point. A good engineer is also a good lawyer ;)

Things we will look for:

- Everything is modulized. Comments to explain your reasoning (I don't need a paragraph explaining. Good engineers will explain in a few sentences)
- Efficiency. code is clean, neat and organized.
- Memory, CPU handling.
- Every error is handled.
- Design and Architecture structure.
- Knowledge of browserless technology
- Routing
- Data manipulation.
- Automation using kue or other job priority libs.

### Detail:

**Learning experience 1:**  
Build an API with scraper.  
When you invent new products, sometimes the data you need isn't available for you yet. Therefore, you must scrape the internet to provide the data for the client users.

**Learning experience 2:**  
Understand data process.  
In order to be a good developer, you must know the lifecycle of every data/parameter/variable you use and HOW, WHY, WHEN they change. This is just simple data process question. That's why you must parse all the data you scrape into a readible JSON format.

### Instructions:
Build two routes: **GET:{baseUrl}/user_profile** and **GET:{baseUrl}/user_profile_continue**

Please upload to a server. AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku, you're own IP Address, etc...it doesn't matter as long as it works somewhere.

### Part 1:
Parameter: username  
Tools (You don't have to use these. You may use different ones or add more if you'd like):  
- cheerio
- puppeteer
- $q

{baseUrl}/user_profile will scrape for user information and returns a JSON formatted response. For example:
```
{
  data: {
    "username": "unumdesign",
    "fullName": "Jack Beanstalk",
    "imageUrl": "profileimage.orsomething.com",
    "followers": 123,
    "following": 12345
  }
}
```
You may provide more information if you'd like but those are the most important ones.

**Errors:**
If there are errors such as "no users exist" or "private users" please handle them correctly.

### Part 2:
Parameter: username  
Tools (You don't have to use these. You may use different ones or add more if you'd like):
- cheerio
- puppeteer
- $q
- kue

GET:{baseUrl}/user_profile_continue will do the same thing BUT it will continue to scrape and console.log out the response every 2 minutes.

The response won't matter. What matters is the console.log output on the terminal that shows the response every 2 minutes and should end after the 10th output. Please use KUE or any other automation for this step.

For example this is what it should show on the terminal:
```
After 2 minutes...
{
  data: {
    "username": "unumdesign",
    "fullName": "Jack Beanstalk",
    "imageUrl": "profileimage.orsomething.com",
    "followers": 123,
    "following": 12345
  }
}

After 2 minutes...
{
  data: {
    "username": "unumdesign",
    "fullName": "Jack Beanstalk",
    "imageUrl": "profileimage.orsomething.com",
    "followers": 123,
    "following": 12345
  }
}

After 2 minutes...
{
  data: {
    "username": "unumdesign",
    "fullName": "Jack Beanstalk",
    "imageUrl": "profileimage.orsomething.com",
    "followers": 123,
    "following": 12345
  }
}

and so on...
```
**Errors:***
If there are errors such as "no users exist" or "private users" please handle them correctly.
